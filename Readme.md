### **What is ONNX?**

**ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**is an open-source format designed to facilitate the exchange of deep learning and machine learning models across various frameworks.
It allows models trained in one framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) to be exported and used in another framework seamlessly.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Interoperability**: ONNX bridges the gap between different ML frameworks by providing a standard format.
  - **Flexibility**: It supports a wide range of machine learning and deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.
  - **Open Ecosystem**: ONNX is supported by various tools and frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and many others.

- **ONNX Model Structure**:
  - **Graph-based Representation**: Models are represented as a computational graph, where nodes represent operations and edges represent tensors passed between operations.
  - **Operator Support**: ONNX provides a comprehensive set of operators (e.g., convolutions, activations, matrix multiplications) for defining models.

Here’s a simple example of building a basic ONNX-based application that performs inference using a pre-trained model. We’ll use a ResNet-50 model (a deep learning model for image classification) for this example.

---

### **Steps to Build a Basic Application in ONNX**

1. **Download a Pre-Trained ONNX Model**
   - You can use pre-trained ONNX models from the [ONNX Model Zoo](https://onnx.ai/model-zoo/).
   - For this example, we will use the `resnet50-v1-7` ONNX model.

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install onnxruntime numpy pillow
     ```

3. **Write the Application**
   - The application will:
     - Load the ResNet-50 ONNX model.
     - Preprocess an input image.
     - Perform inference using ONNX Runtime.
     - Display the predicted class.

---

### **Code Implementation**

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import json
import requests

# Download a sample image for testing
def download_image():
    url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Pug_600.jpg"
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    with open("dog.jpg", "wb") as file:
        file.write(response.content)
    print("Downloaded test image: dog.jpg")

# Preprocess the image for ResNet-50
def preprocess_image(image_path, input_shape):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
    image = image.resize((input_shape[2], input_shape[3]))
    image_data = np.array(image).astype("float32")
    # Normalize the image to [0, 1] range
    image_data = image_data / 255.0
    # Change layout from HWC to CHW
    image_data = np.transpose(image_data, (2, 0, 1))
    # Add a batch dimension
    image_data = np.expand_dims(image_data, axis=0)
    return image_data

# Perform inference
def run_inference(onnx_model_path, input_data):
    session = ort.InferenceSession(onnx_model_path)
    input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name
    outputs = session.run(None, {input_name: input_data})
    return outputs

# Decode the output to get the class label
def decode_predictions(output, labels_file):
    with open(labels_file, "r") as f:
        labels = json.load(f)
    # Get the index of the maximum score
    predicted_class = np.argmax(output[0])
    class_label = labels[str(predicted_class)]
    return class_label

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Download sample image
    download_image()

    # Paths
    model_path = "resnet50-v1-7.onnx"
    labels_path = "imagenet_labels.json"

    # Step 1: Download the ResNet-50 ONNX model and labels (if not already downloaded)
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        print("Downloading ONNX model...")
        url = "https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/resnet/model/resnet50-v1-7.onnx"
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open(model_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(response.content)

    if not os.path.exists(labels_path):
        print("Downloading labels file...")
        labels_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anishathalye/imagenet-simple-labels/master/imagenet-simple-labels.json"
        response = requests.get(labels_url)
        with open(labels_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(response.text)

    # Step 2: Preprocess the input image
    input_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch size, Channels, Height, Width
    input_image = preprocess_image("dog.jpg", input_shape)

    # Step 3: Run inference
    print("Running inference...")
    outputs = run_inference(model_path, input_image)

    # Step 4: Decode predictions
    predicted_label = decode_predictions(outputs, labels_path)
    print(f"Predicted Label: {predicted_label}")
```

---

### **How the Application Works**

1. **Download the ONNX Model and Labels**:
   - The script downloads the ResNet-50 model (`resnet50-v1-7.onnx`) and ImageNet class labels.

2. **Preprocess the Input Image**:
   - The image is resized to `224x224`, normalized to [0, 1] range, and converted to the required shape `(1, 3, 224, 224)`.

3. **Run Inference**:
   - The ONNX Runtime session loads the model and performs inference.

4. **Decode and Display the Prediction**:
   - The predicted class index is mapped to the corresponding ImageNet label.

---

### **Output Example**

If you run the code with the test image (a picture of a dog), the output should look like this:

```plaintext
Downloaded test image: dog.jpg
Downloading ONNX model...
Downloading labels file...
Running inference...
Predicted Label: Pug
```

   - Use ONNX Runtime to classify images in real-time.
2. **Edge Deployment**:
